# To-Do-list

Welcome to my interactive to-do list project! This web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple yet powerful task management tool.


## Features:-

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Click on a task to edit its content.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Local Storage**: Your tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

Creating this project has been a great learning experience for me as a beginner. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of dynamic interactions, event handling, and DOM manipulation in Javascript. The practical implementation of local storage provided hands-on experience in data persistence across sessions. Furthermore, creating this project also increased my understanding of how CSS is used in styling and ensuring interface responsiveness.
